FeynMaster software ( Duarte Fontes, Jorge C. Romão, “ FeynMaster: a plethora of Feynman tools”, Comput.Phys.Commun. 256 (2020) 107311. ) isn't able to show quartic ghost interactions, so a few changes had to be made in order to show the Feynman Rules of the Background Field Gauge. All these changes can be found in the Quartic_Changes.py file. The different models that have been created can be found in the Models folder.
