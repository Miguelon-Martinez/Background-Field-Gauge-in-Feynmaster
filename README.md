FeynMaster software ( Duarte Fontes, Jorge C. Romão, “ FeynMaster: a plethora of Feynman tools”, Comput.Phys.Commun. 256 (2020) 107311. ) isn't able to show quartic ghost interactions, so a few changes had to be made in order to show the Feynman Rules of the Background Field Gauge. All these changes can be found in the Quartic_Changes.py file. The different models that have been created can be found in the Models folder.


In order to run it from your computer, I'd recommend you to change your Addendum.m, Printer.py, Converter.py, General.py and Renapp.py files to those found in this repository's Nucleus folder, as well as pasting the models into your Models folder.

Special thanks to Duarte Fontes for helping me getting accustomed to this software.
